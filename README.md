## TOPIC ##
How safe us your neighbourhood? (Crimes in Berlin, 2012 - 2019)

## DATASET 
Culled from Kaggle (Statistics about crimes from the Commissariat of Berlin)

## CONTEXT ##
Berlin is a special city, multicultural and very diverse, so also is the crime image. I'll try to analyse the trend of crime over 7 years and suggest the safest and least safest areas of the city.

## CONTENT ##
For example there are no bloody drug wars, ghetto or neighborhoods where police afraid to get. Crimes like "larceny" are separated to 4 categories: theft of bikes, of auto, from auto and rest kind of theft. 
"Damage to property due graffiti" (Sach-besch√§digung durch Graffiti (sic!) is in one column. 
Numbers of crimes are connected with every single neighborhood of Berlin. Statistics covering period of 2012 - 2019 years.

## TOOLS ##
Python(Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas), Tableau, Github

## GOAL ##
- What are the safest and least safest areas to reside.
